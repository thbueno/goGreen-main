# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the goGreen project to support creating a specific number of commits per day over a defined date range, rather than the current random distribution approach. The enhancement will allow users to specify a start date, end date, and commits per day to create a more controlled and predictable contribution pattern on their GitHub profile.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to specify a date range and commits per day, so that I can create a predictable contribution pattern over a specific time period.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user specifies a start date of July 10th, 2025, THEN the system SHALL begin creating commits from that date
2. WHEN the user specifies an end date of August 12th, 2025, THEN the system SHALL stop creating commits after that date
3. WHEN the user specifies 6 commits per day, THEN the system SHALL create exactly 6 commits for each day in the specified range
4. IF the date range spans 34 days (July 10 - August 12, 2025), THEN the system SHALL create exactly 204 total commits (34 days Ã— 6 commits)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the commits to be distributed throughout each day, so that the contribution graph shows realistic activity patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating multiple commits for a single day, THEN the system SHALL distribute the commit timestamps across different hours of that day
2. WHEN generating commit times, THEN the system SHALL use random hour and minute values within each 24-hour period
3. WHEN creating commits for the same day, THEN the system SHALL ensure no two commits have identical timestamps

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the enhanced functionality to maintain compatibility with the existing goGreen architecture, so that the core Git operations remain reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating commits, THEN the system SHALL continue to update data.json with each commit's timestamp
2. WHEN all commits are created, THEN the system SHALL perform a single push operation to the remote repository
3. WHEN using the new date range functionality, THEN the system SHALL maintain the existing Git commit format and metadata structure
4. IF an error occurs during the commit process, THEN the system SHALL handle it gracefully without corrupting the Git repository

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure the date range and commit density through code parameters, so that I can easily adjust the settings for different scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the feature, THEN the system SHALL accept a start date parameter in a standard date format
2. WHEN configuring the feature, THEN the system SHALL accept an end date parameter in a standard date format
3. WHEN configuring the feature, THEN the system SHALL accept a commits-per-day parameter as an integer
4. IF invalid date parameters are provided, THEN the system SHALL validate the inputs and provide clear error messages
