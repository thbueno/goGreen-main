# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Create date range generation utility function

  - Implement `generateDateRange(startDate, endDate)` function that creates an array of moment objects for each day in the specified range
  - Add input validation to ensure start date is before end date and dates are valid
  - Write unit tests to verify correct date range generation for various scenarios
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 4.1, 4.2, 4.4_

- [x] 2. Implement daily commit timestamp distribution

  - Create `generateDailyTimestamps(baseDate, commitsPerDay)` function that generates random hours and minutes for commits within a single day
  - Ensure no duplicate timestamps are generated for the same day
  - Add validation to ensure commitsPerDay is a positive integer
  - Write unit tests to verify timestamp distribution and uniqueness
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 4.3_

- [x] 3. Create daily commit processing function

  - Implement `createDailyCommits(baseDate, commitsPerDay, callback)` function that creates multiple commits for a single day
  - Use the timestamp generation function to create distributed commit times
  - Maintain the existing pattern of updating data.json and using simple-git for each commit
  - Implement recursive callback pattern similar to existing `makeCommits` function
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 3.1, 3.3_

- [ ] 4. Implement main scheduled commits orchestrator

  - Create `makeScheduledCommits(startDate, endDate, commitsPerDay)` function as the main entry point
  - Use date range generator to get all dates in the specified range
  - Process each date using the daily commit function with proper callback chaining
  - Ensure single push operation occurs after all commits are complete
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 3.2, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_

- [ ] 5. Add comprehensive input validation and error handling

  - Implement validation for date format parsing using moment.js
  - Add validation to ensure start date is before end date
  - Add validation for positive integer commits per day parameter
  - Create clear error messages for invalid inputs
  - Add error handling for Git operations and file system operations
  - _Requirements: 3.4, 4.4_

- [ ] 6. Update main execution to use scheduled commits

  - Replace the existing `makeCommits(100)` call with `makeScheduledCommits("2025-07-10", "2025-08-12", 6)`
  - Ensure the new function integrates properly with existing imports and dependencies
  - Verify that the execution creates exactly 204 commits (34 days Ã— 6 commits per day)
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4_

- [ ] 7. Create comprehensive tests for the new functionality

  - Write unit tests for date range generation with various edge cases
  - Write unit tests for daily timestamp generation and distribution
  - Write integration tests for the complete scheduled commit flow
  - Create tests for error scenarios and input validation
  - Add tests to verify Git operations and data.json updates work correctly
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 3.4, 4.4_

- [ ] 8. Verify end-to-end functionality and GitHub integration
  - Test the complete flow from July 10, 2025 to August 12, 2025 with 6 commits per day
  - Verify that exactly 204 commits are created with proper timestamps
  - Confirm that data.json is updated correctly for each commit
  - Test that the single push operation works and updates the GitHub contribution graph
  - Validate that commit timestamps are properly distributed throughout each day
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_
